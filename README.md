# Gravitomagnetism-as-an-Emergent-Geometric-Phenomenon
This work presents gravitomagnetism as an emergent Z3 fastener phenomenon, linking quantum spin to macroscopic magnetic fields in magnetars. The model predicts a geometric catastrophe threshold and pulsar spin-axis correlation, offering a unified framework from particles to cosmology.
